Eunomia is part of [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/).

Introduction
============
Eunomia is a standard dataset manager for sample OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CDM) datasets. Eunomia facilitates access to sample datasets from the [EunomiaDatasets repository](https://github.com/ohdsi/EunomiaDatasets). Eunomia is used for testing and demonstration purposes, including many of the exercises in [the Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/). For functions that require schema name, use 'main'.

Features
========
- Download selected sample datasets from [EunomiaDatasets repository](https://github.com/ohdsi/EunomiaDatasets), which includes a subset of the Standardized Vocabularies.
- Interfaces with the DatabaseConnector and SqlRender packages.
- No need to set up a database server. Eunomia runs in your R instance (currently using SQLite). 
- (planned) supports for other databases

Example
=======

```R
library(Eunomia)
connectionDetails <- getEunomiaConnectionDetails()
connection <- connect(connectionDetails)
querySql(connection, "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person;")
#  COUNT(*)
#1     2694

getTableNames(connection,databaseSchema = 'main')
disconnect(connection)
```

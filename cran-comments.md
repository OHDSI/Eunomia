We removed the quotes from OMOP, as it is not a package name but a project (and open source community) name.

We have added more details about the package functionality in your Description text. No literature references are relevant at this point in time.

We have tried to reduce the tarball size as much as possible. This is a data package, containing a standard fully simulated dataset including a subset of the OMOP Vocabulary. We fully expect this dataset to remain constant for a long time. 

This package is / will be used for:
- Examples in our Book of OHDSI
- Testing and working examples in (near) future analytics package that will also be submitted to CRAN.
